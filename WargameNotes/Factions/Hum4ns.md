# Ideas
- Call in ordnance deployed from the Crashed Warship *(Custom Action) (Leader might be able to do a free one) (Might let you also call in extra units)*.
- Better Leadership *(indomitable human spirit) (auto passes moral for x or just gets a better leadership stat)*.
- Maybe something like pushing themselves to get bonuses at risk of damaging themselves (overclock your system) (push past your limits).
- Average sized Squads.
- Average Infantry.
- Average Speed.
- Shooting > Melee.
