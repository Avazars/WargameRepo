# Touchstones
### Alien Faction
- Halo Elites Inspired warrior culture
- Hissho faction from Endless Space 2



# Ideas
- Advanced Technology, Overcharging weapons to deal more damage *(Overcharge could mean shooting waits until end of round)*
- Locked into melee if entered *(Duel) (Enemy would need to make a dangerous terrain test to leave combat)*
- 
- Smaller Squads
- More Elite Infantry
- Fast Speed
- Shooting < Melee
