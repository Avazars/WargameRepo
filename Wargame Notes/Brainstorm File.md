# General Stuff

## Ideas
- Model Agnostic though I have an idea of what I want to use
- High Sci-Fi
- Use a dice pool system where doubles and triples can proc weapon abilities 
- Played on  6'x4' board

## Factions
[[Constructs]]
[[Humans]]
[[Aliens]]


# Playing the Game
## Game Structure
1. Players start the game with sharing their lists with each other going over the detachments that they are taking and what units are in those Detachments, making sure to also cover all [[Wargear]] and [[Leaders]] in their list.
2. Players begin alternating placing terrain on the board and agreeing on what each terrain tags each piece has when it is placed.
3. Next players choose or randomly select what [[Primary Mission]] and [[Deployment Style]] they are going to play with.
4. Both players then perform the [[Deployment Rolloff]], with the winner getting to choose what deployment zone they want, or if they want the first activation. Opponent gets the option not chosen by the winning player.
5. Players deploy detachments in alternating fashion starting with the player who got the first activation (Reserve deployment counts as a deployment)
6. Players declare any before game abilities and place their [[Detachment Directive]] cards.
7. Starting with the player that got the first activation, players activate detachments in an alternating fashion.
8. Inside of a detachments activation
	1. Each units' [[Commander Phase]] abilities trigger
	2. Each unit can choose to move up to its [Movement Value]([[Unit Profile]])
	3. Each unit can choose to perform one [[Standard Action]] 
	4. Each units' [[End Phase]] abilities trigger
9. Once all detachments have been activated that concludes a round, now do it again until you've concluded 4 rounds at which point the player with the most victory points wins the game.

### Detachment Types Table

| Basic Infantry   | 6            | Units in this detachment can choose to move half their movement or perform a standard action once per round when another unit from a different detachment performs an action within 9" of this unit. |
| Elite Infantry   | 3            | Units in this detachment can choose to ignore the first moral roll they would be forced to make each round.                                                                                          |
| Spec-Ops         | 3            | Units in this detachment can choose to start in reserve and at the beginning of the commander phase of another detachment deploy within 9" of that detachments leader.                               |
| Forward Strikers | 2            | Units in this detachment move their normal speed when taking the rush action instead of half speed like normal.                                                                                      |
| Heavy Defenders  | 2            | Units in this detachment provide cover for units that they block LOS for as though they were terrain with the Cover Terrain Tag.                                                                     |
| Titanic          | 1            | Units in this detachment can perform two different actions during the action phase instead of just one.                                                                                              |

### Detachment Leaders
When setting up a detachment you must include a leader model to lead that detachment.
There are 2 different types of leader models: 
Standalone, and Attached leaders.
- Standalone Leaders are units themselves usually composed of one model.
- Attached Leaders are attached to a unit and activate along with that unit.


### Units
- Composed of 1, 3, 5, or 10 models
- We won't do combined units. ex: (combining two 5 mans into a 10 man)

## Building Armies

- First you choose which types of detachments you would like to use
- This will determine what kind of units you are allowed to take and what kind of upgrades you might be able to put on those units.
- Next you choose which leader units you want to lead each detachment and choose which of those leaders will be your force commander.
- Then with the remaining points in each detachment you select units and wargear to fill it out. 
- Units need to have the correct unit type to fit into a detachment slot.
- You can also spend points to get detachment wide upgrades or upgrades to that detachments leader
- Lastly you need to pick 4 out of the 8 available detachment Directives to be able to be used during the game.

**All of this is open information to your opponent**
