# General Stuff

## Ideas
- Model Agnostic though I have an idea of what I want to use
- Sci-Fi Touchstones: Halo, Starfinder, 
- Use a dice pool system where doubles and triples can proc weapon abilities 
- Played on  6'x4' board
- 6s are always successes, and 1s are always failures

More testing

## Factions
[[Constructs]]
[[Humans]]
[[Aliens]]

## Dice Rolling
Players will roll pools of dice ranging from 6-20 to determine the success of an action. There are two types of tests that a unit can make.

**Flat Test**
A flat test is a test that requires the player to roll their pool of dice and get a specific amount of successes to pass the test. These tests usually have a target number of 4+.

> [!Example] Example Flat Test
> A unit that takes a [[Moral Test]] would use their Leadership stat as their dice pool and with a target number of 4+ try to get at least 3 successes.

**Dynamic Test**
A dynamic test is where both players are going to roll a pool of dice at the same time with their own target numbers and try to get more successes then their opponent. During a dynamic test both players will also remove duplicate numbers from across pools. The reason we remove duplicates across pools is because rolling doubles, triples, quads trigger extra effects and we don't want crazy amounts of extra stuff going off all the time with larger dice pools. *The most common kind of ability would be counting extra successes on doubles.*

> [!Example] Example Dynamic Test
> Player one rolls {1,2,2,4,5,6,6} 
> Player two rolls {1,2,3,5,6}
>
> After Cancellation:
> Player one would be left with {2,4,6}
> Player two would be left with {3}
>
> Then both players would count successes.

**Rolling Doubles / Triples**
When you roll doubles or triples you have the ability to trigger abilities like extra hits on doubles. Below is a chart that shows what each type of roll correlates to when checking for ability triggers.

| Roll   | Singles | Doubles | Triples | Quads |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| Single | 1       |         |         |       |
| Double | 2       | 1       |         |       |
| Triple | 3       | 1       | 1       |       |
| Quad   | 4       | 2       | 1       | 1     |
Rolling a Triple would count as 3 singular dice, 1 double, and 1 triple.


# Playing the Game
## Game Structure
1. Players start the game with sharing their lists with each other going over the detachments that they are taking and what units are in those Detachments, making sure to also cover all [[Wargear]] and [[Leaders]] in their list.
2. Players begin alternating placing terrain on the board and agreeing on what each terrain tags each piece has when it is placed.
3. Next players choose or randomly select what [[Primary Mission]] and [[Deployment Style]] they are going to play with.
4. Both players then perform the [[Deployment Roll-off]], with the winner getting to choose what deployment zone they want, or if they want the first activation. Opponent gets the option not chosen by the winning player.
5. Players deploy detachments in alternating fashion starting with the player who got the first activation (Reserve deployment counts as a deployment)
6. Players declare any before game abilities and place their [[Detachment Directive]] cards.
7. Starting with the player that got the first activation, players activate detachments in an alternating fashion.
8. When a detachment is selected each unit inside of that detachment activates and chooses to perform a [[Basic Action]] + a [[Standard Action]] or a single [[Full Action]].
9. Once all detachments have been activated that concludes a round, now do it again until you've concluded 4 rounds at which point the player with the most victory points wins the game.

## Building Armies

- First you choose which types of detachments you would like to use
- This will determine what kind of units you are allowed to take and what kind of upgrades you might be able to put on those units.
- Next you choose which leader units you want to lead each detachment and choose which of those leaders will be your force commander.
- Then with the remaining points in each detachment you select units and wargear to fill it out. 
- Units need to have the correct unit type to fit into a detachment slot.
- You can also spend points to get detachment wide upgrades or upgrades to that detachments leader
- Lastly you need to pick 4 out of the 8 available detachment Directives to be able to be used during the game.
