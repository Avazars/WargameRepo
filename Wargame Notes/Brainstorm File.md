# General Idea Stuff

## Ideas
- Model Agnostic, choose what you feel fits the factions best.
	- I will obviously have my own choices.
- Sci-Fi .
	- Touchstones: Halo, Starfinder, Titan Fall, Endless Space 2, Mass Effect, Starwars.
- Use a dice pool system where doubles and triples can proc weapon abilities or score some form of bonuses that can be used later.
- Played on  6'x4' board.
- 6s are always successes, and 1s are always failures.

| Adjustment             | Feeling          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Dice                   | Volume / Amount  |
| Target Number          | Skill / Accuracy |
| Number of Successes DC | Other Factors    |

## Factions
[[Constructs]]
[[Hum4ns]]
[[Aliens]]

[[Dice Rolling]]


# Playing the Game
## Game Structure
1. Players start the game with sharing their lists with each other going over the detachments that they are taking and what units are in those Detachments, making sure to also cover all [[Wargear]] and [[Leaders]] in their list.
2. Players begin alternating placing terrain on the board and agreeing on what each terrain tags each piece has when it is placed.
3. Next players choose or randomly select what [[Primary Mission]] and [[Deployment Style]] they are going to play with.
4. Both players then perform the [[Deployment Roll-off]], with the winner getting to choose what deployment zone they want, or if they want the first activation. Opponent gets the option not chosen by the winning player.
5. Players deploy detachments in alternating fashion starting with the player who got the first activation. (Reserve deployment counts as a deployment)
6. Players declare any before game abilities and place their [[Detachment Directive]] cards on the side of the table.
7. Starting with the player that got the first activation, players activate detachments in an alternating fashion.
8. When a detachment is selected each unit inside of that detachment activates and chooses to perform a [[Basic Action]] + a [[Standard Action]] or a single [[Full Action]].
9. Once all detachments have been activated that concludes a round, now do it again until you've concluded 4 rounds at which point the player with the most victory points wins the game.


## List Building Rules
**Army**
- You must choose a force commander determining the army wide ability and starting choice of detachment. (This is so I can make subfactions easily).
- Start 10 [[Supply Points]] and 5 Unit slots for each detachment you decide to play with to spend on unit upgrades. (Typical game is 4 Detachments).
- Specialists, Detachment specializations, Wargear upgrades, and powerful units cost supply points.
- Max 3 of any 1 unit profile across the whole army.
