# Touchstones
### Humans
- Titan Fall Stim and Phase Pilots
- Lore is that they are robots, but think they are the Humans as they are the successors to their human creators

# Ideas
- Call in ordnance deployed from the Crashed Warship *(Custom Action) (Leader might be able to do a free one) (Might let you also call in extra units)*
- Better Leadership *(indomitable human spirit) (auto passes moral for x or just gets a better leadership stat)*
- Maybe something like pushing themselves to get bonuses at risk of damaging themselves (overclock your system) (push past your limits)
- Average sized Squads
- Average Infantry
- Average Speed
- Shooting > Melee
